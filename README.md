We believe actual frameworks does not fit with your way of coding. 
Their conventions are not your conventions.
Their choices are not your choices.
We believe writing correct, enterprise class, applications in actual java world is too hard. 

NuunFramework address exactly this.

NuunFramework is meta framework, in the sense : it helps create enterprise class framework with your conventions and your choices.

Dynamic integration, Intelligent injection are 2 innovant paradigms brought by NuunFramework.

It also supports and encourage delegability, open-close principle, inversion of control and Convention over Configuration. 

It brings a powerful and extensible kernel/plugin design plus a JSR 330 compliant injection mechanism
backed by Guice. It is compatible with the major injection frameworks (spring, tapestry, etc ...) 

NuunFramework aims to be the future reference for enterprise framework makers and developpers. 

The summer for developpers ^^
